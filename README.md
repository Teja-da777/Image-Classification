# Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Image Classification

## AIM

To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for image classification and to verify the response for new images.

## Problem Statement and Dataset
The objective of this project is to create a CNN that can categorize images of fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. This dataset includes grayscale images of clothing and accessories such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, and footwear. The task is to accurately predict the correct category for each image while ensuring the model is efficient and robust.

1.Training data: 60,000 images

2.Test data: 10,000 images

3.Classes: 10 fashion categories

The CNN consists of multiple convolutional layers with activation functions, followed by pooling layers, and ends with fully connected layers to output predictions for all 10 categories.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Import the necessary libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and PyTorch.

### STEP 2:
Load and preprocess the dataset:

Resize images to a fixed size (128×128).
Normalize pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.
Convert labels into numerical format if necessary.
### STEP 3:
Define the CNN Architecture, which includes:

Input Layer: Shape (8,128,128)
Convolutional Layer 1: 8 filters, kernel size (16×16), ReLU activation
Max-Pooling Layer 1: Pool size (2×2)
Convolutional Layer 2: 24 filters, kernel size (8×8), ReLU activation
Max-Pooling Layer 2: Pool size (2×2)
Fully Connected (Dense) Layer:
First Dense Layer with 256 neurons
Second Dense Layer with 128 neurons
Output Layer for classification
### STEP 4:
Define the loss function (e.g., Cross-Entropy Loss for classification) and optimizer (e.g., Adam or SGD).

### STEP 5:
Train the model by passing training data through the network, calculating the loss, and updating the weights using backpropagation.

### STEP 6:
Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other performance metrics.

### STEP 7:
Make predictions on new images and analyze the results.

        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)

        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 7 * 7, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.25)

    def forward(self, x):

        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv2(x)))

        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)

        x = self.dropout(self.relu(self.fc1(x)))
        x = self.fc2(x)

        return x

```python
# Initialize the Model, Loss Function, and Optimizer
model = CNNClassifier()
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = model.to(device)

```

```python
# Train the Model
def train_model(model, train_loader, num_epochs=3):
    model.train()

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        running_loss = 0.0
        for images, labels in train_loader:
            images, labels = images.to(device), labels.to(device)
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(images)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

            running_loss += loss.item()

        print('Name: THEJESWARAN M')
        print('Register Number: 212223240168')
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {running_loss/len(train_loader):.4f}')
